    For each sequence (read), get the list of reference positions.
    For exemple the CGTAB sequence could be aligned at positions [1, 4, 100, 200].

    We compute the following stats :
    - pos_stats : the number of sequence aligned at a specific position,
    - sequence_stats: the number of alignment for each sequence.
    
    
    Example (pos_stats):
    The following means:
        - there is 6000 sequences aligned at position 300,
        - there is 3 sequences aligned at position 0.

300: 6000
0: 3
    
    
    Example (sequence_stats):
    The following means the sequence 'GTGTGCTT...':
        - is of length 2513
        - the CGAT bases are present [19.1%, 25.5%, 28.4%, 27.0%] in the sequence
        - is aligned at 9073 different positions
        

GTGTGCTT...
CGAT = [ 19.1, 25.5, 28.4, 27.0] length=2513
9073
